# FirstAngularApp

Welcome to the FirstAngularApp project! This application is built using Angular version 18.1.0, leveraging the powerful Angular CLI for development and build processes. Below you'll find instructions on how to set up your development environment, build the project, and run tests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Angular CLI: Install it globally by running `npm install -g @angular/cli`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Development

### Starting the Development Server

- Run `ng serve` to start the development server.
- Open `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser. The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the source files.

### Generating Components and Services

- Use `ng generate component <component-name>` to create new components.
- You can also generate directives, pipes, services, classes, guards, interfaces, enums, and modules using the `ng generate` command.

## Building the Project

## Testing

### Unit Tests
